###### Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

### Overview of the School District Analysis project
- [X] Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School
- [X] Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis
- [X] Compare the PyCitySchools Module to the PyCitySchools Challenge Code

The purpose of this project was to frame and group student data from specific schools based on multiple categorizes such as school type, school size, school budgets in a certain district. By framing this data, it is easier to list out and understand the student scores for reading and math within those certain categories.

The data in jupyter notebook pieces together the data of this school district.
 
### Process of Analysis
1. Followed the instructions and coded through the module.
2. Followed instructions on the Challenge Starter document.
3. Compared the outputs.
4. Provided further testing possibilities.

### Results from updating the School District Analysis to match Deliverable 1
* How is the district summary affected?
* How is the school summary affected?
* How does replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores affect Thomas High School performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    * Math and reading scores by grade
      * Before
      
      * After
      
    * Scores by school spending
      * Before
      
      * After
      
    * Scores by school size
